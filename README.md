This repository contains an end-to-end comparative business analysis of E-Commerce and Q-Commerce in India using Python. The project transforms raw sales and customer data into actionable insights through data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Objective

- To compare sales, revenue, and profitability between E-Commerce and Q-Commerce platforms.
- To analyze customer experience metrics such as order priority, device usage, and payment preferences.
- To identify product and brand trends based on gender and purchase patterns.
- To predict future sales and profit trends using machine learning models.

## Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy
- Dataset: `Ecom_Qcom.csv` (17,097 rows × 15 columns)

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized sales and customer data.
- Handled null values and formatted columns.
- Created new features such as `Profit Margin`, `Customer Type`, and `Order Priority`.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Sales, profit, and transaction comparisons between E-Commerce and Q-Commerce.
- Analysis of customer types, payment methods, and device usage.
- Product preferences based on gender.
- Discount vs profitability visualizations.

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Performed Chi-Square tests to evaluate relationships:
  - Gender vs Order Priority
  - Product Category vs Brand
  - Product Category vs Product

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Linear Regression to predict future profit and sales.
- Random Forest Regressor for improved accuracy and model generalization.
- Evaluation metrics: R² Score, MAE, MSE.

## Key Insights

- **E-Commerce** leads in total transactions and revenue but grows slower than Q-Commerce.
- **Q-Commerce** shows faster growth potential with predicted sales rising ~29% by 2026.
- Both platforms show nearly identical profit margins (~9.9%), but Q-Commerce is more discount-sensitive.
- Mobile remains the dominant device across both platforms.
- Product and brand preferences vary significantly across gender segments.
- Prediction models indicate high accuracy with R² = 1.0 for Linear Regression.

## Project Outcomes

- Provides a structured comparative overview of two major digital retail models.
- Highlights operational strengths and consumer behavior insights for both platforms.
- Demonstrates advanced proficiency in data analysis and business reporting using Python.
- Offers predictive foresight into sales and profit trends, supporting strategic decision-making.
