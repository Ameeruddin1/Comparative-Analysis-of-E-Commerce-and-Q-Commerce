This academic project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of **E-Commerce** and **Q-Commerce** platforms in India using Python. The study includes platforms like **Amazon, Flipkart** (E-Commerce) and **Swiggy Instamart, Zepto, Blinkit** (Q-Commerce). It transforms raw transactional and customer data into insights through preprocessing, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

## Objectives

- Compare sales, revenue, and profitability between E-Commerce and Q-Commerce companies.
- Analyze customer behavior based on device usage, payment mode, and order preferences.
- Evaluate product and brand patterns across genders and segments.
- Forecast future trends in sales and profit using machine learning models.

  Handles data cleaning, EDA, statistical testing, and model building.

- **Raw Dataset (`Ecom_Qcom.csv`)**  
  Contains transactional data with over 17,000 rows and 15 columns including order type, product, brand, gender, payment method, and profit.

- **Project Report (`Ecom_Qcom Report.pdf`)**  
  A detailed analysis of the project including methodology, visual insights, and conclusions.

- **Project Documentation (`Project Documentation.pdf`)**  
  Includes supporting documents such as certificate, declaration, acknowledgement, and guide approval.

- **README.md**  
  Contains a summary of the project, tools used, insights, and outcomes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled null values, standardized formats  
   - Created features like `Profit Margin`, `Order Priority`, and `Customer Type`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Compared platform performance in terms of sales and profit  
   - Analyzed device usage, gender-based buying behavior, and discount influence

3. **Statistical Testing**  
   - Chi-Square Tests were used to assess:
     - Gender vs Order Priority  
     - Category vs Brand  
     - Category vs Product

4. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Built Linear Regression and Random Forest models  
   - Evaluated using R², MAE, and MSE

---

## Key Insights

- E-Commerce shows higher transaction volume and revenue, while Q-Commerce demonstrates faster growth trends.
- Profit margins are similar (~9.9%), but Q-Commerce is more sensitive to discount strategies.
- Mobile devices are the most common platform for ordering on both sides.
- Brand and product preferences differ notably by gender.
- Predictive models show high accuracy, especially with Random Forest.

---

## Project Outcomes

- Delivers a structured comparison between two evolving retail formats in India.
- Highlights key business and customer insights relevant to each platform type.
- Demonstrates analytical proficiency across data cleaning, statistical testing, visualization, and forecasting.
- Supports academic understanding of applied business analytics in the digital commerce landscape.
