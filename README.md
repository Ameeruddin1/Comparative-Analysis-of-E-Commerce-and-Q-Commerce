## Need for the Study

As India's digital ecosystem matures, conventional E-Commerce models led by Amazon and Flipkart face growing competition from Q-Commerce players like Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, and Zepto. Unlike scheduled deliveries that define traditional E-Commerce, Q-Commerce emphasizes ultra-fast fulfillment — often within 10 minutes — reshaping consumer expectations and business economics.

This rapid transition presents both opportunities and challenges:

- Operational pressure on delivery networks
- Ethical and environmental concerns
- Market disruption and innovation potential

This project evaluates the comparative performance and long-term viability of both models to inform business, investment, and policy decisions.
